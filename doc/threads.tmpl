			     ALARM CLOCK

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),

when timer_sleep() is called we put the thread into a "sleeping list" using a struct which holds the thread, and number of ticks remaining to sleep. 
Then, the function calls sema_down() on the semaphore owned by the thread, (which is initialized to 0.) through an external function in threads.c called block_add().

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

We make two major changes and minimize the time in each in the following ways:

- Timer_sleep()
	We spend as little time as possible by putting it into the list only once, and calling sema_down only once.
	This avoids busy waiting and therefore wastes little time.
- Timer_interrupt()
	We go through the list once regardless of the implementation of priority scheduling, 
	decrementing every ticks variable only once per iteration.
	This happens to take very little time in the intterupt, and causes no busy waiting, because we use sema_up only when the number of ticks remaining is <= 0.
	
---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Race conditions are avoided because all the threads are inserted to the shared waiting list.
We also have each thread own its own semaphore, which does not cause any kind of race condition when multiple sleep or wake.
Another way we handle this race condition is by manipulating the fact that semaphores have interrupts disabled, so this prevents those race conditions.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

This is avoided because we use <= 0 while checking for the number of ticks, so even if we slightly overshoot we are still good.
Furthermore, we use the fact that semaphores have interrupts disable  to prevent those race conditions.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to

Another choice we had was to use a tight loop as it was before we implemented this. This choice would be unoptimal as it causes busy waiting.
By making our own design, we can avoid busy waiting. Another way we considered was not using semaphores, calling thread_block, this has worse synchronization.
The third choice we considered was using the < # of ticks + current tick time > to wake up the threads, but this does not allow for priority sorting, making priority scheduling harder.
This also allows us to avoid the use of another data strucutre, at the cost of one extra operation.

We settled on this choice this specifically as it allows for a safe, lightweight, and portable design. It is portable as it can implement both priority shceduling and MLFQS.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for

We store these in sorted order in the semaphore's list of blocked threads.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

When a higher priority thread attempts to aquire a lock owned by a lower priority thread, the following happens.
- The higher priority thread is added to the lock's waiting list ( in a sorted order ).
- Then, we check if the highest priority element in the list is greater than the priority of the owner of the thread.
	If it is: the priority of the thread is changed to the higher priority. The lower priority is saved so that it can be reverted.
Nested donation is handled via a global list of structs of form <thread, lock> , where the thread refers to the thread donating to the lock owner, and the lock is the lock being donated to.
When a priority donation occurs, we check of the reciever of the highest priority is in the list, and we give it to all children of the second lowest priority.
This logic holds for at least 8 levels.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

Firstly, the lower priority thread's priority is restored to its initial priority.
After that, the highest priority thread in the waiting list aquires the lock.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

To us, this is the only design we chose that was sensible. The other potential design choice was making another list specifically for priority, while basing the other threads based on time they need to sleep for.
This allows us to change the alarm clock code to accomodate priority shceduling, and makes it easy to implement semaphore priority scheduling, as we use only one. This doesn't interfere with this.

We chose an insertion sort for all our lists, as it allows us to take the highest priority thread faster, and is likely going to be called more than inserting the thread. 
This allows for more reliable pre-emption. since set_priority is called only on the running thread, priority will not change during a sort, and the order will not be disrupted.
This design allows us to implement priority donation scheduling by removing threads donated to and re-inserting it*
This may be the only disadvantadge, to our knowledge.

There were no ambiguities in this limited timescale, however given more runtime there would have been ties in priority.
We would resolve these ties in our shceduler by allowing the least nice threads with tied priority to get to run first.
While calculating, we had to decide which calculations to perform first. We decided to calculate load_avg first. 
This matches our shceduler.
